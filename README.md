## Project Charter

Perhaps you are an MSiA student new to the program, hoping to find compatible partners for group projects. Or perhaps you are a singleton in search of a perfect match without resorting to traditional dating apps. Whether you're in need of a new friend or looking to form deep bonds with a like-minded person, a reciprocal recommendation system can give you a little nudge to build a meaningful connection with the right person at the right time. 

**Vision**

In today's fast-paced environment, we don't always have the opportunity to get to know everyone in our community beyond a superficial level. However, we are constantly expected to work with others as part of a team. Business projects and personal life can become dangerously stressful when you and your partner(s) have drastically incompatible personalities.

This app aims to help users find other users with similar personality traits. If deployed in professional settings, the app can also help users make informed decisions about who to team up with on a business project.

**Mission**

Each app user will fill out Cattell's 16 personality survey to the best of their ability. Based on the survey results, the recommender will map the user to a vector in an embedding space with factor and clustering analyses. The recommender will then output a list of new user profiles based on their proximity to the first user profile.

Although the app will ultimately rely on real-time data from its user base, it will use a static dataset for the initial launch. The dataset in question consists of approximately 50000 rows of anonymized user survey results published on [openpsychometrics.org](openpsychometrics.org) (download [here](http://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/16PF.zip)). An interactive version of the survey can be found at [openpsychometrics.org/tests/16PF.php](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/16PF.php).

**Success criteria**

*Machine learning performance metric:* 

Because the recommendation system employs unsupervised learning algorithms, we will use a number of non-traditional model/feature selection metrics to ensure the robustness of our approach. For now, we will rely on the silhoutte score and reduction in SSE to select the optimal number of clusters, and use the Kaiser criteria for dimensionality reduction and factor analysis. Since the method is unsupervised, there's no hard success threshold we can aim for &ndash; however, I hope to retain features that capture around 95% of the variation in the data as I perform factor analysis.

Once the app is launched, we can then calculate the precision, recall, AUC, and F1 score of our recommendation engine based on dynamic user feedback. Tinder's current algorithm has an astonishing AUC of 90% and F1 of 85% &ndash; these are the numbers I'll be aiming for. 

*Business metric:*

We can measure the business value of the app based on user acquisition rates, churn rates, user engagement metrics (e.g. average session duration and total time on app), and of course, the number of successful matches made based on user feedback (e.g. number of successful matches divided by total time on app per user).

## Running the app
### 1. Initialize the database 

#### Create the database 
To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` run: 

`python run.py create_db --engine_string=<engine_string>`

By default, `python run.py create_db` creates a database at `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Adding songs 
To add songs to the database:

`python run.py ingest --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py ingest` adds *Minor Cause* by Emancipator to the SQLite database located in `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Defining your engine string 
A SQLAlchemy database connection is defined by a string with the following format:

`dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`

The `+dialect` is optional and if not provided, a default is used. For a more detailed description of what `dialect` and `driver` are and how a connection is made, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). We will cover SQLAlchemy and connection strings in the SQLAlchemy lab session on 
##### Local SQLite database 

A local SQLite database can be created for development and local testing. It does not require a username or password and replaces the host and port with the path to the database file: 

```python
engine_string='sqlite:///data/tracks.db'

```

The three `///` denote that it is a relative path to where the code is being run (which is from the root of this directory).

You can also define the absolute path with four `////`, for example:

```python
engine_string = 'sqlite://///Users/cmawer/Repos/2020-MSIA423-template-repository/data/tracks.db'
```


### 2. Configure Flask app 

`config/flaskconfig.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Keep True for debugging, change to False when moving to production 
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"  # Path to file that configures Python logger
HOST = "0.0.0.0" # the host that is running the app. 0.0.0.0 when running locally 
PORT = 5000  # What port to expose app on. Must be the same as the port exposed in app/Dockerfile 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///data/tracks.db'  # URI (engine string) for database that contains tracks
APP_NAME = "penny-lane"
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True 
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False  # If true, SQL for queries made will be printed
MAX_ROWS_SHOW = 100 # Limits the number of rows returned from the database 
```

### 3. Run the Flask app 

To run the Flask app, run: 

```bash
python app.py
```

You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

## Running the app in Docker 

### 1. Build the image 

The Dockerfile for running the flask app is in the `app/` folder. To build the image, run from this directory (the root of the repo): 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile -t pennylane .
```

This command builds the Docker image, with the tag `pennylane`, based on the instructions in `app/Dockerfile` and the files existing in this directory.
 
### 2. Run the container 

To run the app, run from this directory: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane
```
You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

This command runs the `pennylane` image as a container named `test` and forwards the port 5000 from container to your laptop so that you can access the flask app exposed through that port. 

If `PORT` in `config/flaskconfig.py` is changed, this port should be changed accordingly (as should the `EXPOSE 5000` line in `app/Dockerfile`)

### 3. Kill the container 

Once finished with the app, you will need to kill the container. To do so: 

```bash
docker kill test 
```

where `test` is the name given in the `docker run` command.

### Example using `python3` as an entry point

We have included another example of a Dockerfile, `app/Dockerfile_python` that has `python3` as the entry point such that when you run the image as a container, the command `python3` is run, followed by the arguments given in the `docker run` command after the image name. 

To build this image: 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

then run the `docker run` command: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane app.py
```

The new image defines the entry point command as `python3`. Building the sample PennyLane image this way will require initializing the database prior to building the image so that it is copied over, rather than created when the container is run. Therefore, please **do the step [Create the database with a single song](#create-the-database-with-a-single-song) above before building the image**.

# Testing

From within the Docker container, the following command should work to run unit tests when run from the root of the repository: 

```bash
python -m pytest
``` 

Using Docker, run the following, if the image has not been built yet:

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

To run the tests, run: 

```bash
 docker run penny -m pytest
```
